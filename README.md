The ug_stereomatcher ROS package comprises the University of Glasgow GPU stereo matcher and nodes to compute point clouds from disparity maps for each operational mode as described below.

The matcher has two operational modes:

1. Compute disparity maps over a image pyramid at full resolution in 10 seconds on 16MP RGB images
2. Compute foveated disparity maps for each level on the pyramid in 3 seconds on 16MP RGB images with a fixed fovea size of 615 by 407
