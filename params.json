Compute disparity maps over a image pyramid at full resolution in 10 seconds on 16MP RGB images\r\n2. Compute foveated disparity maps for each level on the pyramid in 3 seconds on 16MP RGB images with a fixed fovea size of 615 by 407\r\n\r\n## Publications\r\n\r\nIf you use this ROS package please cite the following paper(s):\r\n\r\n* Cockshott, P., Oehler, S., Xu, T., Siebert, J.
